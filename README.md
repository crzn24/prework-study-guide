Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Boot Camp Prework Study Guide was made for boot camp students to help them study and reference the topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript with notes for each. The initial webpage was created during the prework to learn about these topics firsthand and experience some of the obstacles and bugs developers might run into on a daily basis.
